An example of securing an eXist-db app

A basic need for a website is to add authentication so that the website knows who is using it and that the pages can adapt to the roles that the user is allowed to perform.  Without authentication, eXist-db gives the user ‘guest’ privileges.

The documentation on the eXist-db website about security is here:
